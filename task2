What is a Socket?
A socket is a communication endpoint in computer networking, identified by a unique combination of an IP address and a port number. It facilitates
communication between processes or applications running on different devices connected to a network.


How Sockets Work:

Socket Creation:
A program creates a socket using the appropriate programming interface provided by the operating system or a network library.

Binding:
The socket is bound to a specific IP address and port number, which serves as its unique identifier.

Listening (Server) / Connecting (Client):
In a server, the socket listens for incoming connection requests. Clients connect to the server's socket.

Data Transfer:
Once a connection is established, data can be sent and received bidirectionally between the client and server.

Closing:
When the communication is complete, the sockets are closed.

Types of Sockets:

Stream Sockets (TCP):
	Provides a reliable, connection-oriented communication.
	Ensures data delivery in the correct order without errors.

Datagram Sockets (UDP):
	Provides a connectionless, unreliable communication.
	Used when low overhead and speed are more critical than guaranteed delivery.

Port Numbers:

Port numbers are 16-bit unsigned integers, ranging from 0 to 65535.
Port numbers 0 to 1023 are well-known ports, reserved for specific services. For example:
80: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) 443: HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
21: FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
25: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)


Types of Connections:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
	Connection-oriented protocol.
	Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
	Suitable for applications where accurate data delivery is crucial, such as file transfers or web browsing.


UDP (User Datagram Protocol):
	Connectionless protocol.
	Does not guarantee reliable delivery, ordered sequencing, or error checking.
	Used in applications where low latency and minimal overhead are more critical, such as real-time streaming or online gaming.
